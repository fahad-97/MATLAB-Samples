%During my Mechanical Engineering course at University, first-year coursework involved the creation of a script which took inputs of point forces applied along a beam's length, outputting the shear force and bending moment distribution. This piece of coursework obtained full marks, and the m-file (script) is presented below:

disp('consider all forces to be positive in the downwards direction')
L=input('insert here the length of the beam (distance A to B) in m: ');
disp('now, insert all following values in vector form [a b c ... z]')
disp('and in order of distance from point A on the beam')
wvector=input('insert forces (in N): ');
pvector=input('insert distances (in m): ');
N=length(wvector);
x=linspace(0,L,1001);
y1=linspace(0,L,1001);
y2=linspace(0,L,1001);
yQ=zeros(1,1001);
yM=zeros(1,1001);
for n=1:N
    W=wvector(n);
    P=pvector(n);
    
    y1(1:1001)=0;
    diff=abs(x-P);
    lim=find(diff==min(diff));
    y1(1:lim)=W;
    yQ=yQ+y1;
    
    y2(1:1001)=0;
    y2(1:lim)=-W*(P-x(1:lim));
    yM=yM+y2;
end
